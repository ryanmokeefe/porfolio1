                            I'm a full Stack Web Developer who is driven by curiosity and a lifelong dedication to learning. Passionate about transcending barriers by the universal diffusion of knowledge, I excel at problem solving through innovative thinking, creativity, and resourcefulness.

                        <h3> BACKGROUND </h3>
                        <p>
                            Previously, I worked in retail and customer service for ten years, including as a senior team lead at Target where I was responsible for daily store operations, team management, and processing logistics. I've spent the last four years also working in the event industry as an A/V and lighting technician, building sets for business conventions, award ceremonies, and music festivals. 
                            Through all of this, I've learned the importance of teamwork as well as taking the inititive to be able to work independently.

                        <p>
                            When I'm not creating things with code I love to create all sorts of things with other materials and get lost exploring new places. You can find me either sketching, lost in a good book, or getting lost on a new trail.
